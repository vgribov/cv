## Summary ##

An experienced C/C++ developer with a pragmatic and minimalistic approach. I started writing my first C programs and discover the Linux Kernel in middle school. Now I have a fundamental computer science education and more than 12-year experience in fields from machine control systems to networking and automotive. My passion is to make things better.

An overview of my career includes these highlights:

* *Luxoft GmbH*: As a senior C++ developer I am working with Qt framework on behalf of Daimler to implement HMI for their new infotainment system. I focus mostly on stability and performance issues and responsible for communication with backend services. I also participate in porting the HMI on the Android platform. 
* *Larch Networks*: As a lead developer, I've participated in creating OpenSwitch ASIC plugin for the newest Marvell Bobcat 3 packet processor. Then as a team lead, I've ported it on Cortex-A9 CPU with Aldrin packet processor. I've also developed "from scratch" a C++ written DHCPv6 server for Panasonic enterprise switches.
* *UnIT*: Working mostly with Qt, I've developed workstation software for an excise stamps quality control system, a fingerprint recognition system, and a mobile passport issuance system.
* *SKBIS*: As a result of my university research, I've developed an automatic position sensor adjustment system. I've also developed firmware for 9 of 10 modules in SKBIS's machine tool position control system.

## Perfect knowledge of C/C++ and Qt

I started writing my first C programs in the 8th school's grade. Now I'm a C language native speaker, knowing both POSIX and latest C99 standards and GNU extensions. I wrote programs mostly for reliable embedded systems, starting from small AVR OS-less applications ending with complex Linux-based open-source projects such as OpenSwitch.

In parallel with C, I've been constantly working with C++. Mainly for creating user-friendly GUI based workstation applications. Tired from MFC during my work in SKBIS I decided to try Qt. Now it's my favorite GUI framework. In 2014 I got carried away with C++11. I've written a DHCPv6 server on pure C++11 using only STL. Now I am working on a huge Qt-based HMI project with Daimler which is written in C++14.

## Solid understanding of Linux for embedded systems ##

At the programming classes in the middle school, we used FreeBSD on our workstations and discover the Linux kernel sources. In recent years, I've studied Linux along and across. I've ported Linux on at least 3 different embedded platforms, working both with U-Boot and kernel sources. I've used BuildRoot, Yocto and even some handwritten scripts to generate a Linux root file system. I also have some experience with Wayland, which is used heavily in
automotive HMIs.

## Real life experience with networking protocols and Marvell chips ##

I have been working in networking for more than two and a half years. In Larch Networks I worked on creating a security WiFi USB dongle based on TI's Sitara SOC and WL1837MOD. I've also participated in developing a FreeRTOS based solution for clever unmanaged switches with Marvell's AlleyCat3, BobCat2 and BobK packet processors inside. I've worked both with CPSS library and packet processor registers directly, setting up Multicast groups, VLANs and policies for our customers. I've worked on developing an OpenSwitch plugin for BobCat3, implementing access lists, VLAN interfaces, and L3 routing. I've developed "from scratch" a DHCPv6 server for Panasonic and ported the FPA library on Aldrin packet processor.

## Knowledge of electrical circuits and measurement software ##

During my work in Larch Networks, I had to deal with complex schematic diagrams of network equipment, adjusting the device tree, and various Linux kernel modules to boards' hardware. I've been working for 5 years in SKBIS, a Russian manufacturer of motion sensors, developing both firmware, and workstation software. I have created from the ground up a digital device based on the TMS320 signal processor, which I've used to measure and adjust signals from motion sensors. I have experience with Altium, Multisim, and Quartus and have worked with Altera FPGAs and Verilog language.

## Scripting languages for testing and automation ##

I started to use PHP as a hobby and as a part-time job, making web sites while studying at university. Then I switched to Perl as a wonderful tool to automate my everyday development tasks. Currently, I use Python and bash scripts for automation, complex feature testing, and code generation.

## Experience with various collaboration software ##

I have worked with various task tracking systems, and collaboration software, such as Redmine, GitLab, BitBucket, Jira, Confluence, Slack, and Zulip. Last 5 years I constantly work with the Scrum framework. I prefer to use Git as a version control system and also have some experience with SVN, CVS, and Mercurial.

## Creativity and self-learning ability ##

I love to write programs. For me, it's an exciting chance to create something new and make our world better. I love code simplicity and minimalistic approach with a focus on using the standard library and avoiding unneeded external dependencies. I can be agile but prefer to have a clear specification with a road map and milestones. Before each new project, I tend to ask myself "what's new I can learn from it?". If nothing I try to introduce this "new" by myself. So I like being a team change agent.

## Communication and leadership skills ##

For the last several years I've always worked in international teams, communicating over e-mail and Zoom meetings, assigning tickets, and making code reviews on Gerrit. My colleagues note my responsiveness and reliability. At my workplace, I try to maintain a friendly atmosphere of mutual assistance. In Larch Networks I also have had six months of experience leading a team of five developers.
