# Vsevolod Gribov #

C/C++ developer.

## Summary ##

An experienced C/C++ developer with pragmatic and minimalistic approach. I
started writing my first C programs and discover Linux Kernel in middle school.
Now I have a fundamental computer science education and more then 10 year
experience in fields from machine control systems to networking and automotive.
I am not afraid of difficulties and know how to solve you problems right.

An overview of my career includes these highlights:

* Luxoft: As a senior C++ developer I am working with Qt on behalf of Daimler
  to implement an HMI for Auxiliary Caravaning Unit.
* Larch Networks: As a lead developer I've participated in creating an
  OpenSwitch ASIC plugin for the newest Marvell Bobcat 3 packet processor. Then
  as a team lead I've ported it on Cortex-A9 CPU with Aldrin PP. I've also
  developed "from scratch" a C++ written DHCPv6 server for Panasonic enterprise
  switches.
* UnIT: Working mostly with Qt I've developed workstation software for an
  excise stamps quality control system, a fingerprint recognition system and
  mobile passport issuance system.
* SKBIS: I've developed an automatic sensor adjustment system and 9 of 10
  modules of the Positional Program Management System worked with my firmware.

## Great development experience in C language ##

I started writing my first C programs in the 8th school's grade. Now I'm really
a C language native speaker, knowing both POSIX and latest C99 standards and
GNU extensions. I wrote programs mostly for reliable embedded systems, starting
from small AVR OS-less applications ending with complex Linux-based open source
projects such as OpenSwitch.

## Good knowledge of C++ and Qt ##

In parallel with C, I've been constantly working with C++. Mainly for creating
user friendly GUI based workstation applications. Tired from MFC during my work
in SKBIS I decided to try Qt and now thats my favourite GUI framework. I used
it heavily during my work in UnIT and I was always able to achieve the required
result in a very short time. In 2014 I got carried away with C++11. I've
written a DHCPv6 server on pure C++11 using only STL. Now I am working on a Qt
based HMI for Daimler's Auxiliary Caravaning Unit which is completely written
on C++11 with elements of C++17.

## Scripting languages for testing and automation ##

I started to use PHP as a hobby and as part-time making web sites while
studying at university. Then I switched to Perl as a wonderful tool to automate
my development tasks in SKBIS. Now I mainly use bash scripts and Makefiles for
automation and Python for complex feature testing.

## Solid understanding of Linux on embedded systems ##

At the programming classes in the middle school we used FreeBSD on our
workstations and discover the Linux kernel sources. Over the past few years
I've studied Linux along and across. I've ported Linux on at least 3 different
embedded platforms, working with both U-Boot and kernel sources. I've used
BuildRoot and Yocto and even handwritten scripts to generate a Linux rootfs.
Now I concentrate myself on Wayland and it's reference compositor
implementation - Weston.

## Real life experience with networking protocols and Marvell chips ##

I have been working in networking for more than two and a half years. In Larch
Networks I worked on creating a security WiFi USB dongle based on TI's Sitara
SOC and WL1837MOD. I've also participated in developing a FreeRTOS based
solution for clever unmanaged switches with Marvell's AlleyCat3, BobCat2 and
BobK packet processors (PP) inside. I've worked both with CPSS library and PP
registers directly, setting up Multicast groups, VLANs and policies for our
customers. I've worked on developing an OpenSwitch FPA plugin for BobCat3,
implementing access lists, VLAN interfaces and L3 routing. I've developed "from
scratch" a DHCPv6 server for Panasonic and ported the FPA library on Aldrin PP.

## Creativity and self-learning ability ##

I love to write programs, for me thats not only an algorithm formalization, but
also an exciting chance to create something new. I love the code simplicity and
prefer the minimalistic approach. I can be agile but prefer to have a clear
specification with a road map and milestones. Before each new project I tend to
ask myself "what's new I can learn from it?". If nothing I try to introduce
this "new" into the project by myself. I like being a team change agent.

## Communication and leadership skills ##

Most of the time I have been working in small teams of two or three people. For
the last several years I have been constantly involved in projects with
international teams, communicating over the Skype, e-mail, task tickets and
peer reviews. My colleagues note my responsiveness and ability to maintain a
friendly atmosphere of mutual assistance, thus the last six months I work as a
team lead.
